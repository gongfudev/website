## Feedback on study of @olange and @rudifa

[rudifa / Hexagonal game board  with ‹hex grid› cells](https://observablehq.com/@rudifa/hexagonal-game-board-with-hex-grid-cells)   
_a notebook that adds visual representations of our hex spiral algorithms_

[d3 / d3-scale-chromatic](https://github.com/d3/d3-scale-chromatic)  
_we rediscovered these color scales; Rudi used them to color the cells of the game board randomly_

[Hexagonal Grids › Coordinate systems](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates)  
_we also extensively discussed the cube/axial/pixel coordinate systems (again)_

[d-arcade › Geometry of the game – Explainer](https://github.com/olange/arcade/wiki/Geometry-of-the-game-–-Explainer)
_and made a recap of what we'll need to represent the components of our game_

… and we got lost for a little while on [seenthis](https://seenthis.net/) and [visionscarto.net](https://visionscarto.net), which I shortly presented to Rudi.
