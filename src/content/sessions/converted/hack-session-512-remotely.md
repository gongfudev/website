## Feedback on @olange and @rudifa's session

After 4 weeks of a stop, because @olange was travelling abroad in family, it was kind of a restart:

* We examined [LitElement JavaScript starter](https://github.com/lit/lit-element-starter-js) in detail, discussed about how we could integrate it in our project and how it would impact our existing Snowpack build chain;
* we exchanged about our latest readings and news about family; @olange read [Getting Clojure](https://pragprog.com/titles/roclojure/getting-clojure/) by Russ Olsen and [Release It!](https://pragprog.com/titles/mnee2/release-it-second-edition/) by Michael Nygard during its lengthy oversea flights, and played with [Babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka), a native fast-starting Clojure interpreter, which can be used for scripting on the command-line;
* we exchanged about [MobileCoin](http://mobilecoin.foundation) and its amazing technical achievements, which brings _mobile payments_ to everyone of us, cross-borders, without any custodian (no bank or intermediate involved, which could veto the transaction), low fees (0.00004 MOB/tx), quick settlement (<5 sec.) and total privacy; there is no mining (coins have all been emitted) and the validator nodes don't know about the involved parties and amounts of the transactions (true privacy), while still providing validation and ensuring that there is no double-spend.
