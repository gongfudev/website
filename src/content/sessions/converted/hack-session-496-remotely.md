## Feedback on study of @olange and @rudifa

* Review with Rudi and improvements of the [H3 geospatial indexes playground](https://observablehq.com/@olange/h3-geospatial-indexes-playground) notebook by @olange on Observable
* Study of the tessellation of the globe by H3 indexes and experiments with the [«Exploring H3 and tesselations on the sphere»](https://observablehq.com/@tmcw/h3) notebook by Tom MacWright on ObservableHQ
* Discussion about listening to music and our personal tastes; Rudi was listening to [«Mozart — Complete Piano Sonatas & Pieces» by Claudio Arrau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UvgqXHK_HI) when we started the session, Olivier to [«Music IS» by Bill Frisell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_IS)

## Post-session study

* Exploration of the various spheric and planar projections of the sphere of the [@d3/d3-geo](https://observablehq.com/collection/@d3/d3-geo) and [@d3/D3-geo-projection](https://observablehq.com/collection/@d3/d3-geo-projection) collections on ObservableHQ

  (an article featured on the [arbor.js](http://arborjs.org/introduction) website docs, which shows how quad-trees partition a space and how the calculation of force-directed graphs and forces in large particle systems can be simplified/accelerated)
