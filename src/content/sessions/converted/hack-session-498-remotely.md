## Feedback on study of @olange and @rudifa

Working on a [‹h3-minimap› web component](https://observablehq.com/@olange/h3-minimap) in ObservableHQ:

* setup of the H3, D3 and Lit dependencies;
* setup of the Web Component within a notebook;
* designed the Web Component API — `areas` and `projection` attributes — and defined a default set of values.
