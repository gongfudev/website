## Feedback on session #574 of @rudifa and @olange

More than «a bit» of Go yesterday evening, quite a lot, looking at Rudi's recent experiments:

* to [extract metadata and all contents of a Notion database](https://github.com/rudifa/go-notion);
* as well as [from an HTTP API endpoint](https://github.com/rudifa/go-swisstopo) ([geo.admin.ch › mapserver](https://api3.geo.admin.ch/rest/services/api/MapServer));
* using [Cobra](https://cobra.dev) to build the command-line.

Initial research based on this awesome talk, featured on [Getting Started with Go](https://go.dev/learn/):

* [Building an Awesome CLI App in Go – OSCON 2017](https://spf13.com/presentation/building-an-awesome-cli-app-in-go-oscon/) by [Steve Francia](https://spf13.com/) and [Ashley McNamara](https://twitter.com/ashleymcnamara)

Upcoming work:

* using [GJSON](http://github.com/tidwall/gjson) and [SJSON](http://github.com/tidwall/sjson) to manipulate JSON data;
* leverage [CUE](https://cuelang.org) to validate data; and generate configuration.
