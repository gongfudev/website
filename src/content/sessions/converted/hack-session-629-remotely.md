* gongfudev/website#14  
  Integrated @rudifa's work on migrating the issues and comments from this repo into the `src/content/sessions` content collection of our new Astro website
* Refactored the `tag` property into `audience`/`tracks`/`techno` properties
* Discussed how to list those new `audience`/`tracks`/`techno` properties  
  and how to regroup the sessions around them
