## Feedback on the session of @olange and @rudifa

Review of @rudifa's work on migrating the descriptions and comments of the issues of this repository, using the GitHub GraphQL API, to a [plain JSON file](https://github.com/rudifa/gongfudev-website/blob/add-hack-sessions/src/data/issues.json); and discussion about how to pivot this data to the upcoming website of Gōng-fu DEV, built with Astro (gongfudev/website#13).
