Reviewed with @rudifa the ETL pipeline he built to query all issues with comments thru GitHub's GraphQL API, and transform them to individual HTML fragments.

<hr/>

The [prototype project](https://github.com/rudifa/astro-gfio-sessions-comments) fetches the Hack Session data via [github graphql](https://api.github.com/graphql) and uses the [marked.js](https://marked.js.org/) package to convert the markdown data fragments to HTML in Astro components.

Renamed the prototype project to [astro-gfio-sessions](https://github.com/rudifa/astro-gfio-sessions-comments.git) and published it on [netlify](https://astro-gfio-sessions.netlify.app/).
