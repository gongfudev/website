## Feedback on @olange and @rudifa's session

Fixed the `docs` script of our [‹h3-worldmap›](https://github.com/olange/h3-worldmap) web component, which was broken since last week.

Studied Lit documentation:

* [Lit › Reactive properties › Attributes › Providing a custom converter](https://lit.dev/docs/components/properties/#conversion-converter)
* [Lit › Reactive properties › Customizing change detection](https://lit.dev/docs/components/properties/#haschanged)
* [Lit › Reactive properties › Custom property accessors](https://lit.dev/docs/components/properties/#accessors-custom)
* [Lit › Lifecycle › Reactive update cycle › `willUpdate`](https://lit.dev/docs/components/lifecycle/#willupdate)

as well as all examples of the [Lit Playground](https://lit.dev/playground/).
