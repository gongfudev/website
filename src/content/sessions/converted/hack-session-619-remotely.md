## Feedback on session #619 of @olange and @rudifa

* We upgraded the official [Astro Portfolio](https://astro.build/themes/details/portfolio/) template, along with all the deps of the [Gōng-fu DEV website](https://github.com/gongfudev/website), to their latest versions.
* We merged the Portfolio template in the root of the website.
* [Published the website with Vercel](https://website.gongfu-dev.vercel.app/) upon pushing to the repo.
* Added the [Vercel integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/slack) to Slack and configured it to receive messages of Vercel's activity in the `#activity-vercel` channel
* Finally, we played with DALL·E to generate [light smooth gradients](https://github.com/gongfudev/website/blob/b9fab5e8a9c270d7f815e25f608efa0679fa345f/public/assets/smooth-light-gradient.webp) for replacing the hero banners of the Portfolio template.
