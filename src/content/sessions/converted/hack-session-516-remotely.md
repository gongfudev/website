## Feedback on @olange and @rudifa's session

We prepared the migration of our [‹h3-minimap›](https://observablehq.com/@olange/h3-minimap) Observable notebook source code to an [‹h3-worldmap›](https://github.com/olange/h3-worldmap) web component on GitHub and published an initial (so far, useless) version on [NPMjs.org](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@olange/h3-worldmap).

Looked at source code of various [Hexgrid JS libraries](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html#third-party), and  [flauwekeul/honeycomb](https://github.com/flauwekeul/honeycomb).
